        <h2>WHAT IS <br> DIABETS?</h2>
        <p>Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. 
            Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. 
            Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, 
            helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. 
            Sometimes your body does not make enough—or any—insulin or does not use insulin well. 
            Glucose then stays in your blood and does not reach your cells.
            Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. 
            Although diabetes has no cure, you can take steps to manage your diabetes and stay healthy.  
            Sometimes people call diabetes “a touch of sugar” or “borderline diabetes.” 
            These terms suggest that someone does not really have diabetes or has a less serious case, but every case of diabetes is serious.

          <h2>DANGEROUS OF <br> DIABETES</h2>
          <p>Long-term complications of diabetes develop gradually. 
             The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications. Eventually, 
             diabetes complications may be disabling or even life-threatening. 
             Their impact is:

            <p> Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of various cardiovascular problems, 
                including coronary artery disease with chest pain (angina), 
                heart attack, stroke and narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis). If you have diabetes, 
                you're more likely to have heart disease or stroke. Nerve damage (neuropathy).

            <h2>HOW TO <br>CURE <br> DIABETES</h2>
            <img class="cure" src="media/cure.jpg" alt="cure">
            <p> Although there is no complete cure or medication for diabetes, 
                it can be alleviated and treated and controlled through medication and controlled diet. 
                Some people will go into remission in the process, 
                thus reducing the suffering caused by diabetes.
